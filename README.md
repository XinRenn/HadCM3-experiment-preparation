Backup of the scripts I used for my new experiments preparation.
Scripts are not so clean, even a little bit messy, but they work.
Only used to modify the maritime continent area. For other areas in the world, need to do some easy edits on the scripts.

Usage: sh Make_test_exp.sh
Modify the heading info for the new exp
